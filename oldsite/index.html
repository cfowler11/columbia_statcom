			<h1>Welcome to the Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club!</h1>

		  <p>The computing club hosts casual seminars focusing on computational topics often encountered in biostatistics
				research.  The tutorials provide hands-on learning at a variety of skill levels,
				with some focused on bringing new students up to speed and others addressing more advanced problems.
				Our overarching goal is to impart good programming practices that encourage collaborative
				 reproducible research!</p>

			<p>This year's organizers are <a href="http://www.juliawrobel.com">Julia Wrobel</a>, 
				 <a href="mailto:hs2937@cumc.columbia.edu">Hartaig Singh</a>, and <a href="https://margarethannum.github.io/">Margaret Hannum</a> all students in the <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics">
			Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University</a>. The group is run with the help of faculty advisor
	 				<a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cmm2212">Christine Mauro</a>. A schedule for the upcoming semester is below.
					If there are other topics you'd like to cover in the future, please let us know!
