Today I'm giving a talk at 12:00 in the biostatistics computer lab on simple rules for writing a research paper.
[Here](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/12/17/088278.full.pdf) is a link to the paper I used as a guiding resource for the talk.

I have also included my slides for the talk below as a resource when writing your own papers.

I still need to edit the slides below
