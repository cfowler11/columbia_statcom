  <h1>How to become a contributing member of this blog</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>This is a blog post about how to start making blog posts! The computing club blog is hosted through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub Pages allows you to host and build websites for free directly through GitHub.</p>

<p>If you are a biostatistics student interested in becoming a contributing member of the blog, follow the steps below to get editorial access to the website so you can start generating content.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t already have one, <a href="https://github.com">sign up for a GitHub account</a> and select a username and password. Once you have signed up for your GitHub account, email me (jw3134@cumc.columbia.edu) with your username so that I can grant you access to edit the blog as a collaborator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/columbia-computing-club">GitHub homepage for the computing club</a>. The username for this group is columbia-computing-club. Under the <strong>Repositories</strong> tab you will see a repository called <strong>columbia-computing-club.github.io</strong>. Repositories in GitHub are online folders where you store your programming projects. The <em>columbia-computing-club.github.io</em> repository is where all files for the computing club website are stored. There is a reason for this weird nomenclature. All GitHub users can host a website for free using GitHub Pages, but in order to host this way you must use the naming format <em>your-username.github.io</em>. Note: <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">This tutorial</a> is an excellent beginner’s guide for setting up a website using Github Pages, if you’re interested.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once I see your email about editorial access to the columbia-computing-club.github.io repository, I will add you as a collaborator. You will then receive an email from me inviting you to the repo. Once you accept the invitation, you will have collaborator access!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now to start writing your post! First go to the <a href="https://github.com/columbia-computing-club/columbia-computing-club.github.io">repo for the computing club website</a>. Click on the <em>_posts</em> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Create new file</strong>. Name your file. It must follow the naming convention <em>YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-my-post.md</em>. This filename gets translated into a link for the post. The file extension ‘.md’ stands for <em>Markdown</em>, which is a user-friendly language that generates blog posts into html for websites. There are many <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown resources</a> for making fancier posts. Follow the example post below for getting started: <center><img src="/assets/20170116_blog2.png" width="1010" /></center></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are happy with your post, click <strong>Commit changes</strong>, and the post should be live in a few minutes! You can view it at http://columbia-computing-club.github.io/YYYY/MM/DD/name-of-your-post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have fun, and good luck!</p>
