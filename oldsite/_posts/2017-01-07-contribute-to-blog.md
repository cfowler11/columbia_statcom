This is a blog post about how to start making blog posts! The computing club blog is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub Pages allows you to host and build websites for free directly through GitHub.

If you are a biostatistics student interested in becoming a contributing member of the blog, follow the steps below to get editorial access to the website so you can start generating content.

1. If you don't already have one, [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com) and select a username and password. Once you have signed up for your GitHub account, email me (jw3134@cumc.columbia.edu) with your username so that I can grant you access to edit the blog as a collaborator.

2. Check out the [GitHub homepage for the computing club](https://github.com/columbia-computing-club). The username for this group is columbia-computing-club. Under the **Repositories** tab you will see a repository called **columbia-computing-club.github.io**. Repositories in GitHub are online folders where you store your programming projects. The *columbia-computing-club.github.io* repository is where all files for the computing club website are stored. There is a reason for this weird nomenclature. All GitHub users can host a website for free using GitHub Pages, but in order to host this way you must use the naming format *your-username.github.io*. Note: [This tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) is an excellent beginner's guide for setting up a website using Github Pages, if you're interested.

3. Once I see your email about editorial access to the columbia-computing-club.github.io repository, I will add you as a collaborator. You will then receive an email from me inviting you to the repo. Once you accept the invitation, you will have collaborator access!

4. Now to start writing your post! First go to the [repo for the computing club website](https://github.com/columbia-computing-club/columbia-computing-club.github.io). Click on the *_posts* folder.

5. Click **Create new file**. Name your file. It must follow the naming convention *YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-my-post.md*. This filename gets translated into a link for the post. The file extension '.md' stands for *Markdown*, which is a user-friendly language that generates blog posts into html for websites. There are many [Markdown resources](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for making fancier posts. Follow the example post below for getting started: <center><img src="/assets/20170116_blog2.png" width="1010"></center>


6. Once you are happy with your post, click **Commit changes**, and the post should be live in a few minutes! You can view it at http://columbia-computing-club.github.io/YYYY/MM/DD/name-of-your-post.

7. Have fun, and good luck!
