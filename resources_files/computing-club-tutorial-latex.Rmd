## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


**Problem 1**:

(1) A discrete random variable $X$ has a probability mass function of the form $P(X=x) =\frac{k}{2^x}$ for $x= 1,2,3$ and zero otherwise, find $k$.

We know that the $\sum_{x=1}^{3} \frac{k}{2^x} = 1$. Therefore, we have that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{x=1}^{3} \frac{k}{2^x} &= \frac{k}{2^1} + \frac{k}{2^2} + \frac{k}{2^3} \\
&=  \frac{k}{2} + \frac{k}{4} + \frac{k}{8} \\
&= \frac{7k}{8}\\
\Rightarrow k = \frac{8}{7} \\
\square
\end{aligned}
$$

(2) Can a function of the form $f(x)=c(2^{-x}-0.5)$ for $x= 0,1,2$ and zero otherwise be a probability mass function of a random variable?

$f(0)=c(2^{-0}-0.5)= .50c \\$ 
$f(1)=c(2^{-1}-0.5)= 0 \\$
$f(2)=c(2^{-2}-0.5)=-.25c \\$
$f(0) + f(1) + f(2) = .25 \\$
$\Rightarrow c = 4 \\$

However, we know that $f(2)=4(2^{-2}-0.5)=-1$ Which is a contradiction since for a pdf $f(x) \geq 0$. Thus $f(x)$ is not a pdf $\square$

**Problem 2**:  A function of the form $f(t)=ct^{-c-1}I\{t >1\}$ for $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$.

(1) If $f(t)$ is a probability density function, find the value of $c$.

We use the definition of a pdf to show that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) dt &= 1 \\
 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) dt &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} ct^{-c-1}I\{t >1\} dt \\
                                 &= \int_{1}^{\infty} ct^{-c-1} dt \\
                                 &= -t^{-c} \Big|_1^\infty \\
                                 &= \frac{1}{\infty^c} + 1^{-c} \\
                                 \Rightarrow c > 0
\end{aligned}
$$
We know this since if $c = 0$ then we would get that $f(t)=0 \Rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)tx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 0dt=0$ which is a contradiction of the definition of a pdf. 

Furthermore if we have $c < 0$ then we would get that $\frac{1}{\infty^c} + 1^{-c} = \infty$, which also contradicts the definition of a pdf and that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)dt = 1 \square$.

(2) Find the corresponding cumulative distribution function of $f(t)$ in (1).

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(T \leq t) &= F_T(t) \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{t} f_T(x) dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{t} cx^{-c-1}I\{x >1\} dx \\
&= \int_{1}^{t} cx^{-c-1} dx \\
&= -x^{-c} \Big|_1^t \\
&= -t^{-c} + 1^{-c} \\
&= (1-\frac{1}{t^c})I\{t >1\}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Problem 3**: Suppose $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ for $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$ are probability density functions. Let $a \geq 0$ and $b \geq 0$ are two fixed constants satisfying $a + b = 1$. Prove that $af(t) + bg(t)$ is also a probability density function for $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$.

To show that $af(t) + bg(t)$ is a pdf we prove that $af(t) + bg(t) \geq 0, \forall x$ and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} af(t) + bg(t) dt = 1$.

1. We first show that $af(t) + bg(t) \geq 0$:

Assume that there exist a t such that $af(t) + bg(t) < 0$. This implies that at least one of the two terms is the function are negative. From this we know that if $af(t) < 0$ either $a < 0$ or $f(t) < 0$ which is a contradiction since we know that $f(t) \geq 0$ (by the definition of a pdf) and $a>0$ by the statement of the problem. If $bg(t) < 0$ then either $b < 0$ or $g(t) < 0$ which is also a contradiction, since we know that $g(t) \geq 0$ (by the definition of a pdf) and $b>0$ by the statement of the problem. Therefore by contradiction, we know that $af(t) + bg(t) \geq 0$

2. We show that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (af(t) + bg(t)) dx = 1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (af(t) + bg(t)) dt &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} af(t)dt + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}bg(t) dx  \\
                                               &= a\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)dt + b\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(t) dx \\
                                               &= a(1) + b(1),  \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \text{since the Defintion of pdf we know that} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)dt = 1, \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(t)dt = 1\\ 
                                               &= a + b \\
                                               &= 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

From this we know that the definition of a pdf holds for $af(t)+bg(t)$. $\square$
